Scripts used for the paper "A depauperate immune repertoire precedes evolution of sociality in bees" (Barribeau, Sadd, du Plessis and many more), Genome Biology (2015). 

Use these scripts at your own risk! THey may need some tweaks or fixes for different gene sets or organisms. No documentation is available for these scripts and I don't plan on writing. They are effectively unsupported, but if you have questions please get in touch with me and I may still be able to help.
